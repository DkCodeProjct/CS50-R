It's not over yet
Tell me, why you startin' a fire?
It's burnin' up in my head
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?
Why you gotta tear my heart out?
Leave me in the rain
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?

When the light fades and the dawn breaks
That's when it's hardest to fix it
When you're lonely and your heart aches
That's when you know what you're missin'
Hold up, let me get my story straight
It hit me like a tidal wave
Won't you give me just another day
To tell myself

It's not over yet
Tell me, why you startin' a fire?
It's burnin' up in my head
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?
Why you gotta tear my heart out?
Leave me in the rain
Why do I always tell myself that It's not over yet?

Yet-yet, yet-yet, yet-yet
It's not over yet

Show me where to look for a halo
Oh, I'm sick and tired of the pain, so
I don't wanna be the one to let go
Oh, no
But why is everybody tellin' me it's over?
Tryna shut the voices out to get in closer
Help me stay alive just so I can show ya
